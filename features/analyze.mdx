## Using the Charts

### Metric Trend Chart (Left)

Shows your selected metric's score over time.

**What you'll see**:
- Line chart with data points
- X-axis: Time (dates)
- Y-axis: Score (0-100)
- Hover tooltips with exact values

**Use cases**:
- Identify upward or downward trends
- Spot sudden changes
- Correlate score changes with your marketing activities

### Subcomponent Trend Chart (Right)

Shows the individual sub-metrics that combine to create the overall score.

**What you'll see**:
- Multiple lines (one per sub-metric)
- Same time period as left chart
- Different colored lines for each component
- Legend showing which line is which

**Use cases**:
- Understand what's driving overall score changes
- Identify which sub-metric needs attention
- See if improvements in one area are offset by declines in another

<Tip>
  If your overall score is flat but you see diverging sub-metric lines, it means improvements in some areas are being offset by declines in others. Focus on the declining components.
</Tip>

## Score Breakdown

Click to expand the breakdown and see exactly how your score is calculated.


**What you'll see**:
- List of all sub-metrics
- Each sub-metric's individual score
- Weight percentage (how much it contributes)
- Weighted contribution to final score
- Description of what each sub-metric measures

**Example for Visibility**:
- Mention Frequency: 85 × 30% weight = 25.5 points
- Position Quality: 72 × 25% weight = 18.0 points
- Template Coverage: 68 × 20% weight = 13.6 points
- Consistency: 90 × 15% weight = 13.5 points
- Share of Voice: 55 × 10% weight = 5.5 points

**Total Visibility Score**: 76.1 / 100

<Info>
  Focus optimization efforts on high-weight components for maximum impact. A 10-point improvement in a 30% weighted component adds 3 points to your overall score, while the same improvement in a 10% weighted component only adds 1 point.
</Info>

## Understanding Trends

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upward Trend 📈">
    **What it means**: Your efforts are working

    **Actions**:
    1. Document what changed to cause the improvement
    2. Double down on successful strategies
    3. Share wins with stakeholders
    4. Plan next phase of optimization
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Downward Trend 📉">
    **What it means**: Performance is declining

    **Possible causes**:
    - Competitor improvements
    - Negative PR or reviews
    - AI model updates (training data changes)
    - Content becoming stale
    - Website issues affecting crawlability

    **Actions**:
    1. Check competitor activity (did they launch new content?)
    2. Review recent news/reviews about your brand
    3. Check AI model changelog for updates
    4. Refresh stale content
    5. Investigate in Insights panel
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Flat Trend →">
    **What it means**: Performance is stable but stagnant

    **Actions**:
    1. Test new optimization strategies
    2. Run A/B experiments
    3. Expand prompt coverage
    4. Consider more aggressive tactics
    5. Analyze competitors' tactics
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Volatile / Erratic">
    **What it means**: Inconsistent performance, high variance

    **Possible causes**:
    - Small sample size (not enough prompts)
    - Recent AI model changes
    - Seasonal effects
    - Insufficient data points

    **Actions**:
    1. Add more prompts to increase sample size
    2. Use longer time periods (30+ days) to smooth volatility
    3. Focus on sub-metrics with more stable patterns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Data Source

<Note>
  **Important**: The Analyze page shows metrics calculated from **system-generated prompts** (~25 prompts created during onboarding Phase 4).

  These prompts cover standard brand health queries and are different from the user-created prompts you see on the Define page.

  **Why separate?**
  - System prompts provide consistent, standardized brand health measurement
  - User prompts track custom queries you specifically care about
  - Both are valuable but serve different purposes
</Note>

---

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Weekly">
    **Frequency**: Check Analyze page once per week

    **What to do**:
    - Review overall brand health score
    - Scan for significant trend changes (>10% movement)
    - Read new insights in the panel
    - Note any competitive alerts

    **Time required**: 5-10 minutes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deep Dive Monthly">
    **Frequency**: Monthly detailed analysis

    **What to do**:
    - Review each metric's detailed breakdown
    - Compare 30-day vs 90-day trends
    - Identify patterns and correlations
    - Plan optimization initiatives based on insights

    **Time required**: 30-45 minutes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Strategic Review Quarterly">
    **Frequency**: Quarterly business review

    **What to do**:
    - Analyze 90-day and 180-day trends
    - Benchmark against competitors
    - Assess ROI of AEO initiatives
    - Set strategic goals for next quarter

    **Time required**: 1-2 hours
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Focus on One Metric at a Time">
    **Why**: Diluting efforts across all 4 metrics reduces impact

    **Strategy**:
    1. Pick your priority metric based on business goals
    2. Run a focused 30-day improvement campaign
    3. Measure results
    4. Move to next priority metric

    **Example**: E-commerce brand focuses on Purchase Intent first, then Sentiment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Realistic Goals">
    **Short-term (1-3 months)**: 5-10 point improvements
    **Medium-term (3-6 months)**: 15-20 point improvements
    **Long-term (6-12 months)**: 25+ point improvements

    **Note**: Diminishing returns apply - moving from 40 to 60 is easier than 80 to 90
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Metric Priority by Business Type

Not all metrics matter equally for every brand:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="E-Commerce">
    **Priority Order**:
    1. Purchase Intent (drives conversions)
    2. Sentiment (affects buying decisions)
    3. Visibility (top-of-funnel awareness)
    4. Authority (trust factor)

    **Focus**: Conversion optimization
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="B2B SaaS">
    **Priority Order**:
    1. Authority (trust is critical)

    3. Visibility (category presence)
    4. Sentiment (reputation)

    **Focus**: Establishing expertise
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Consumer Brands">
    **Priority Order**:
    1. Sentiment (brand perception)
    2. Visibility (brand awareness)
    3. Purchase Intent (consideration)
    4. Authority (credibility)

    **Focus**: Brand perception and awareness
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Professional Services">
    **Priority Order**:
    1. Authority (expertise demonstration)
    2. Sentiment (reputation)
    3. Visibility (thought leadership)
    4. Purchase Intent (less relevant for services)

    **Focus**: Establishing expertise and trust
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No data showing / Loading skeleton">
    **Cause**: Analysis not yet complete for this brand

    **Solution**: Wait 2-5 minutes after completing onboarding. System prompts are analyzed automatically in the background.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scores seem too low/high">
    **Cause**: Limited data points or unusual sample

    **Check**:
    - Are system prompts being analyzed regularly?
    - Is your brand name spelled correctly in brand settings?
    - Are competitors set up correctly?

    **Solution**: Contact support if scores seem incorrect after verifying setup
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Charts not updating after period change">
    **Cause**: UI refresh issue

    **Solution**: Refresh the page. If issue persists, clear browser cache.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing insights for a metric">
    **Cause**: Not enough data or no actionable patterns detected

    **Solution**: This is normal - insights only appear when AI identifies specific, actionable recommendations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
