## Score Breakdown

Expandable component showing detailed sub-metrics that contribute to each score.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/analyze-score-breakdown.png"
    alt="Score Breakdown"
    style={{ borderRadius: '12px' }}
  />
</Frame>

### How Scores Are Calculated

Each metric score (0-100) is calculated from weighted sub-components:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Visibility Calculation">
    ```
    Visibility Score =
      (Mention Frequency × 0.30) +
      (Position Quality × 0.25) +
      (Template Coverage × 0.20) +
      (Consistency × 0.15) +
      (Share of Voice × 0.10)
    ```

    **Example**:
    - Mention Frequency: 80
    - Position Quality: 75
    - Template Coverage: 70
    - Consistency: 85
    - Share of Voice: 60

    **Score**: (80×0.3) + (75×0.25) + (70×0.2) + (85×0.15) + (60×0.1) = **75.5**
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sentiment Calculation">
    ```
    Sentiment Score =
      (Positive Mentions × 100) +
      (Neutral Mentions × 50) +
      (Negative Mentions × 0)
      ÷ Total Mentions
    ```

    **Example**:
    - 70% Positive → 70 points
    - 25% Neutral → 12.5 points
    - 5% Negative → 0 points

    **Score**: **82.5**
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Authority Calculation">
    ```
    Authority Score =
      (Source Quality × 0.40) +
      (Expertise Recognition × 0.30) +
      (Citation Context × 0.20) +
      (Category Leadership × 0.10)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Purchase Intent Calculation">
    ```
    Purchase Intent Score =
      (Recommendation Strength × 0.40) +
      (Purchase Language × 0.30) +
      (Comparison Positioning × 0.20) +
      (Use Case Matching × 0.10)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Understanding Weighted Components**: Higher-weighted factors have more impact on your final score. Focus optimization efforts on high-weight components for maximum score improvement.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Setting Realistic Goals

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Short-Term (1-3 months)" icon="calendar">
    Aim for 5-10 point improvements in individual metrics through tactical optimizations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium-Term (3-6 months)" icon="calendar-days">
    Target 15-20 point improvements through sustained content and authority building
  </Card>
  <Card title="Long-Term (6-12 months)" icon="calendar-range">
    Strive for 25+ point improvements with comprehensive AEO strategy
  </Card>
  <Card title="Competitive Parity (varies)" icon="users">
    Match top competitor scores in priority metrics
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Prioritizing Metrics

Not all metrics matter equally for every brand:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="E-Commerce Brands">
    **Priority**: Purchase Intent > Sentiment > Visibility > Authority

    **Reasoning**: Driving conversions is the primary goal
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="B2B SaaS">
    **Priority**: Authority > Purchase Intent > Visibility > Sentiment

    **Reasoning**: Trust and expertise drive B2B decisions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consumer Brands">
    **Priority**: Sentiment > Visibility > Purchase Intent > Authority

    **Reasoning**: Brand perception and awareness drive consumer choice
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Professional Services">
    **Priority**: Authority > Sentiment > Visibility > Purchase Intent

    **Reasoning**: Expertise and reputation are critical for services
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scores Not Updating">
    **Cause**: No recent prompt executions or data refresh needed

    **Solution**: Execute prompts from the Define page to generate fresh data
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing Data for Specific Metric">
    **Cause**: Insufficient prompt coverage for that metric type

    **Solution**: Create more prompts targeting that metric (e.g., purchase-focused prompts for Purchase Intent)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inconsistent Scores Across Models">
    **Cause**: Different training data and source preferences

    **Solution**: This is normal - optimize for the models most important to your audience
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sudden Score Drop">
    **Causes**: Competitor improvement, negative PR, AI model update, or technical issue

    **Solution**: Check competitor activity, recent news, AI model changelog, and re-execute prompts
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  **Pro Tip**: Focus on improving one metric at a time. Trying to optimize all four simultaneously dilutes effort. Pick your priority metric based on business goals and execute a focused 30-day improvement campaign.
