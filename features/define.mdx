## Using Filters & Search

### Search Bar

Type to filter prompts by:

### Tag Filters

Click tags to filter:
- **Multiple tags**: Shows prompts matching ANY selected tag (OR logic)

<Info>
  Tag filtering uses OR logic. If you select "product" and "comparison", you'll see prompts that have EITHER tag, not necessarily both.

- **With Brand**: Only prompts where your brand name appears in AI responses

<Warning>
  Prompts "without brand" indicate visibility gaps - your brand isn't appearing in responses where it should.
</Warning>

- **7 Days**: Recent short-term trends
- **30 Days**: Longer-term patterns (default)

Affects trend indicators and score calculations in the table.

## Understanding the Data

### Visibility Score

**What it measures**: How often your brand appears in AI responses to this prompt (0-100)

**Calculation**:
- Runs the prompt across multiple AI models
- Counts how many responses mention your brand
- Normalizes to 0-100 scale

**Interpretation**:
- **80-100**: Excellent - Brand appears in almost all responses
- **60-79**: Good - Strong presence, some room for improvement
- **40-59**: Moderate - Brand mentioned in about half of responses
- **0-39**: Low - Significant visibility gap

### Sentiment Score

**What it measures**: How positively/negatively AI models discuss your brand (0-100)

**Scale**:
- **70-100**: Positive sentiment

### Share of Voice

**What it measures**: Your brand's percentage of total brand mentions in responses

**Example**: If a response mentions 3 brands, and your brand is mentioned twice, your share of voice is 66%.

**Use case**: Track competitive positioning in multi-brand responses

### Trends

**Visual**: Up/down/neutral arrows with percentage change

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with 10-20 Prompts">

    **How**: Mix different prompt types (awareness, comparison, problem-solving)

    **Tip**: Use "Get Friction Suggestions" to bootstrap your library
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Tags Consistently">

    **Suggested tags**:
    - "brand-awareness"
    - "product-comparison"

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Focus on Low-Visibility Prompts">
    **Why**: Biggest opportunity for improvement

    **Strategy**:
    1. Filter for prompts with visibility < 40
    2. Check if your brand SHOULD appear for these queries
    3. Create content that answers these questions
    4. Monitor improvement over time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compare 7-day vs 30-day Trends">
    **Why**: Distinguish noise from real changes
