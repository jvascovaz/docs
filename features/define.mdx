    src="/images/define-search.png"
    alt="Search Functionality"
    style={{ borderRadius: '12px' }}
  />
</Frame>

```
Examples:

    Begin with essential brand and product queries. Don't overwhelm yourself.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Expand Gradually (30-50)">
    Add category queries, comparisons, and problem-solving prompts as you learn what matters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maintain Regularly (50-100)">
    Mature brands maintain 50-100 prompts covering all brand touchpoints and use cases.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize Continuously">
    Review performance monthly, archive low-value prompts, create new ones based on insights.
  </Step>
</Steps>
