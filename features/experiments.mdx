## Understanding Results

### Metric Comparison

Results show scores for each target metric in both buckets:


#### How to Read Results:

**Visibility Comparison**:
- **Control**: 68/100
- **Variant**: 82/100
- **Lift**: +14 points (+20.6%)

**Interpretation**: Variant prompts resulted in significantly better brand visibility across AI models.

**Action**: Adopt variant prompt style for visibility improvement. The experiment shows that the new prompt approach leads to your brand appearing more frequently and prominently in AI responses.

### Statistical Significance

<Info>
  **Confidence Level**: Results are considered statistically significant if the confidence level exceeds 95%.

  **Sample Size**: Larger prompt sets (20+ per bucket) yield more reliable results.
</Info>

#### Interpreting Significance:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High Confidence (95%+)">
    **Meaning**: Very likely the observed difference is real, not random chance

    **Action**: Confidently implement the winning variant
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Medium Confidence (80-95%)">
    **Meaning**: Likely a real difference, but some uncertainty remains

    **Action**: Consider running a larger follow-up experiment or implement cautiously
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Low Confidence (<80%)">
    **Meaning**: Observed differences may be due to chance

    **Action**: Run longer experiment with more prompts, or interpret results as inconclusive
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Winner Determination

friction automatically recommends a winner based on:

1. **Primary Metric Performance**: Largest improvement in target metrics
2. **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level of results
3. **No Negative Impacts**: Guard rail metrics don't decline significantly
4. **Consistency**: Performance across different AI models

## Best Practices

### Designing Good Experiments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test One Variable">
    Change one thing between control and variant for clear causality

    **Good**: Control uses features, Variant uses benefits

    **Bad**: Control uses features + formal tone, Variant uses benefits + casual tone (which caused the difference?)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Sufficient Sample Size">
    Aim for 10-20 prompts per bucket minimum

    **Why**: Larger samples reduce noise and increase confidence
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run for Appropriate Duration">
    Allow nightly job to execute multiple times if needed

    **Recommendation**: Let experiments run for at least 7 days for AI model caching to settle
  </Step>
  <Step title="Align with Business Goals">
    Focus on prompt strategies that improve visibility for your business context

    **E-Commerce**: Test product-focused prompts
    **B2B SaaS**: Test expertise and solution prompts
    **Consumer Brand**: Test brand awareness prompts
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Experiment Ideas

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Prompt Framing">
    **Control**: "What is [Product]?"

    **Variant**: "How can [Product] help me?"

    **Tests**: Question framing impact on recommendations
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Feature vs Benefit">
    **Control**: "Features of [Product]"

    **Variant**: "Benefits of using [Product]"

    **Tests**: Whether benefits drive better sentiment/purchase intent
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Comparison Positioning">
    **Control**: "[Brand] vs [Competitor]"

    **Variant**: "Why choose [Brand] over [Competitor]?"

    **Tests**: Assertive positioning impact
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Specificity">
    **Control**: "Best project management software"

    **Variant**: "Best project management software for remote teams"

    **Tests**: Niche targeting vs broad queries
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Problem-Solution">
    **Control**: "What does [Product] do?"

    **Variant**: "How does [Product] solve [problem]?"

    **Tests**: Problem-solution framing effectiveness
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
  **Don't end experiments prematurely**. Wait for full execution and statistical significance before drawing conclusions.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Testing Too Many Variables">
    **Problem**: Can't identify which change caused the difference

    **Solution**: Test one major variable at a time
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Insufficient Prompts">
    **Problem**: Results lack statistical power

    **Solution**: Use 10-20 prompts per bucket minimum
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ignoring Negative Results">
    **Problem**: Only implementing winning experiments misses learnings

    **Solution**: Document why variants failed - equally valuable insight
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not Aligning with Strategy">
    **Problem**: Running random experiments without clear goals

    **Solution**: Tie experiments to specific business objectives
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Forgetting to Implement Winners">
    **Problem**: Running experiments but not applying insights

    **Solution**: Create action plan to implement winning prompts across Visibility page
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
