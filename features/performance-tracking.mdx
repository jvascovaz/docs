### Monitoring Frequency

- **Daily**: Check overall performance score and alerts
- **Weekly**: Review trend analysis and competitive positioning
- **Monthly**: Deep dive into comprehensive reports
- **Quarterly**: Strategic planning based on long-term trends

### Key Actions

Based on performance tracking insights:

1. **Low Visibility**: Increase content production and optimization
2. **Poor Sentiment**: Address negative feedback sources
3. **Weak Authority**: Build thought leadership content
4. **Low Intent**: Improve product information and reviews

## Advanced Features

### Custom Metrics

Create custom KPIs tailored to your business:

```python
# Example custom metric configuration
custom_metric = {
  "name": "Brand Preference Score",
  "formula": "(visibility * 0.3) + (positive_sentiment * 0.4) + (purchase_intent * 0.3)",
  "threshold": 75,
  "alert_on_decrease": True
}
```

### Cohort Analysis

Segment performance data by:
- User intent (research vs. purchase)
- Query complexity (simple vs. detailed)
- Time of day/week patterns
- Seasonal variations

### Predictive Analytics
