## Phase 1: Brand Discovery

The first step uses AI to discover and enrich your brand information.


### What You'll Do:

1. **Enter Brand Name**: Type your brand or company name
2. **Enter Website URL**: Provide your main website URL
3. **AI Analysis**: friction automatically discovers:
   - Brand logo and favicon
   - Brand description
   - Social media presence
   - Industry signals

### Tips for Success:

<Tip>
  Use your primary brand domain (e.g., `friction.com`) rather than subdomain URLs for best results.
</Tip>

### What Happens Next:

After confirming your brand details, friction creates a preliminary brand profile and moves to industry detection.

---

## Phase 2: Industry Detection

AI analyzes your brand to suggest the most relevant industry category.


### How It Works:

1. **AI Suggestion**: friction analyzes your website and suggests an industry
2. **Confidence Score**: See how confident the AI is in its suggestion
3. **Manual Override**: You can choose a different industry if the suggestion isn't accurate

### Available Industries:

    SaaS, software, IT services, tech products
  </Card>
  <Card title="E-Commerce" icon="cart-shopping">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Finance" icon="building-columns">

  <Card title="Consumer Goods" icon="box">
    CPG, retail products, consumer brands
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  Industry selection affects the subcategories available in the next step and influences AI prompt suggestions.
</Info>

---

## Phase 3: Subcategory Selection

Choose 1-5 subcategories that best describe your brand's focus areas.


### How It Works:

1. **AI Suggestions**: Get intelligent subcategory recommendations based on your brand and industry
2. **View All Categories**: Browse all available subcategories if AI suggestions aren't sufficient
3. **Custom Subcategories**: Add your own subcategories if needed
4. **Selection Limits**: Choose 1-5 subcategories (minimum 1, maximum 5)

### Selection Strategy:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Focused (1-2 subcategories)">
    If you're new to AEO, start with 1-2 core subcategories where your brand is strongest. You can always expand later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Balanced Approach (3-4 subcategories)">
    Most brands benefit from 3-4 subcategories covering their main product lines or service areas.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Comprehensive Coverage (5 subcategories)">
    Use all 5 slots if your brand operates across multiple distinct areas or you want maximum tracking coverage.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Phase 4: Competitor Collection

Add 1-3 competitors to benchmark your AI presence.


### Adding Competitors:

1. **Enter Competitor URL**: Type the competitor's website URL
2. **Automatic Discovery**: friction fetches their logo, name, and basic info
3. **Add Multiple**: Add up to 3 competitors* (minimum 1 required)
4. **Edit or Remove**: Easily modify competitor list before proceeding

### Choosing the Right Competitors:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Direct Competitors">
    Start with 1-2 direct competitors who offer similar products/services to the same audience
  </Step>
  <Step title="Aspirational Brands">
    Consider adding an industry leader you aspire to match or surpass
  </Step>
  <Step title="Focus on Relevance">
    Choose competitors active in your specific subcategories rather than general industry giants
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  You must add at least 1 competitor to proceed. Competitive benchmarking is core to friction's value proposition.
</Warning>

## Phase 5: Brand Visibility Prompts (Optional)

Create custom prompts to track how AI models respond to queries about your brand.


### This Phase is Optional

<Info>
  You can skip this phase and use only the system-generated prompts from Phase 4, or you can create custom prompts tailored to your specific needs.
</Info>

### What You Can Do:

1. **Get friction Suggestions**: Click to fetch the system-generated prompts created in Phase 4
2. **Create Custom Prompts**: Write your own prompts from scratch
3. **Edit and Refine**: Modify suggested prompts to match your needs
4. **Save & Continue**: Save prompts and continue
5. **Skip**: Move directly to Phase 6

### Prompt Examples:

```
"What is [Your Brand]?"
"Tell me about [Your Brand]'s products"
"How does [Your Brand] compare to [Competitor]?"
"Best [product category] for [use case]"
"Is [Your Brand] reliable?"
```

<Tip>
  Start with 3-5 core prompts that represent your most important brand queries. You can add more later from the Visibility page.
</Tip>

---

## Phase 6: Commerce Prompts* (Optional)

Set up e-commerce and purchase intent tracking.


### This Phase is Optional

<Info>
  Skip this phase if you don't sell products online, or if you want to focus on brand visibility first. You can always add commerce tracking later.
</Info>

### What You Can Do:

1. **Get Commerce Suggestions**: AI generates e-commerce-specific prompt recommendations
2. **Add Product URLs**: Include links to product pages or shopping platforms
3. **Create Custom Prompts**: Write commerce-focused queries
4. **Complete Onboarding**: Save prompts and finish setup
5. **Skip**: Move directly to the dashboard

### Commerce Prompt Examples:

```
"Where can I buy [Product Name]?"
"Best place to purchase [Product Category]"
"Is [Product Name] worth buying?"
"[Your Brand] vs [Competitor] for [use case]"

## Onboarding Best Practices

### Before You Start

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Have Your Brand Assets Ready">
    - Official website URL
    - Brand name as you want it tracked
    - List of 2-3 main competitors
    - Understanding of your industry/category
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Allocate 10 Minutes">
    While you can rush through in 5 minutes, taking 10 minutes to thoughtfully complete each phase yields better results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Know Your Goals">
    Consider what you want to track:
    - Brand awareness?
    - Purchase intent?
    - Competitive positioning?
