# AI Score

AI Score is friction AI's top-level metric for AI-driven discovery. It summarizes how strongly AI assistants recommend your brand across tracked prompts through three key drivers: Visibility, Sentiment, and Purchase Intent.

---

## Definition

AI Score is a composite score that summarizes how strongly AI assistants recommend your brand in purchase-intent and consideration queries, relative to your competitors, based on tracked prompts over time.

<Info>
  **In plain terms**: AI Score shows how likely AI is to recommend you when customers ask what to buy.
</Info>

## What It's Made Of

The AI Score is built from three components that together capture both presence (are you in the answer?) and preference (are you the recommended choice?).

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Visibility" icon="eye">
    How often your brand is mentioned in AI responses
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sentiment" icon="face-smile">
    How positively your brand is described when mentioned
  </Card>
  <Card title="Purchase Intent" icon="cart-shopping">
    How often your brand is suggested as an option to buy or choose
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why These Components

These three dimensions cover the full spectrum of what makes a recommendation compelling:

- **Visibility** ensures you're part of the conversation
- **Sentiment** ensures you're portrayed positively
- **Purchase Intent** measures direct recommendation strength

---

## How It's Calculated

<Note>
  The AI Score is computed as a weighted combination of the three components above. Weighting is optimized to reflect recommendation outcomes, not raw mentions.
</Note>

The exact weighting prioritizes signals that correlate with actual recommendations over simple visibility metrics. A brand that appears rarely but is consistently recommended will score higher than one that's mentioned often but never suggested as a choice.

## Scope and Granularity

Your AI Score can be viewed at multiple levels:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Platform">
    See your score across each AI platform:
    - ChatGPT (OpenAI)
    - Claude (Anthropic)
    - Gemini (Google)
    - Google AI Overviews
    - Perplexity
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By Category">
    Break down scores by prompt category or topic area to see where you perform best and where you need work.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By Time Range">
    Track changes over 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or longer to identify trends and measure improvement.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="vs Competitors">
    Compare your score directly against tracked competitors to understand your relative position.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  Your AI Score is an aggregate across all tracked prompts. Your scores by category or platform may differ significantly. A strong overall score can mask weaknesses in specific areas.
</Warning>

## How to Interpret Changes

### When Your Score Goes Up

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="You appear in more answers">
    AI is mentioning your brand more frequently across prompts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="You're recommended more directly">
    When you appear, AI is positioning you as a choice to consider or buy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Your framing becomes more positive">
    The language AI uses about your brand is more favorable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### When Your Score Goes Down

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Competitors are recommended more often">
    Your share of recommendations is decreasing relative to others.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Your sentiment shifts negative or neutral">
    AI's portrayal of your brand is less favorable than before.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="You drop out of high-intent prompts">
    You're appearing less in queries where purchase decisions happen.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The query mix changes">
    New prompts were added or removed, changing the sample.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Edge Cases and Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="LLM outputs can be variable">
    AI responses aren't deterministic. friction AI reduces noise by running prompts repeatedly and aggregating results over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scores reflect observed outputs">
    Your AI Score reflects what AI actually says today, not guaranteed future answers. Model updates can shift results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="External factors matter">
    Results can shift due to AI model updates, changes in browsing/citation behavior, or seasonal query intent.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Examples

### Example A: High Visibility, Low Recommendation

**Situation**: Your Visibility score is 75, but your Purchase Intent score is 40.

**What it means**: AI mentions you often, but rarely suggests you as the "best" option or recommends you directly.

**Fix focus**:
- Product comparisons and "best for" content
- Review aggregation and social proof
- Clear use-case positioning

### Example B: Low Visibility, High Sentiment

**Situation**: Your Visibility score is 35, but your Sentiment score is 85.

**What it means**: When AI does mention you, it's very positive. But you're absent from many prompts entirely.

**Fix focus**:
- Content coverage and entity optimization
- Citation building and distribution
- Expanding presence in new query categories

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is AI Score the same as share of voice?">
    No. Share of voice typically measures raw mention frequency. AI Score is weighted toward recommendation outcomes, meaning it prioritizes being suggested as a choice over simply being mentioned.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why does my score differ by platform?">
    Each AI platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) uses different models, training data, and citation behaviors. It's normal to perform better on some platforms than others.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often does the score update?">
    Scores update based on your analysis schedule. System prompts run automatically, and scores reflect the most recent data from tracked prompts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I compare my score against competitors?">
    Yes. friction AI tracks the same prompts for your competitors, so you can see exactly how your AI Score compares to theirs.
  </Accordion>
